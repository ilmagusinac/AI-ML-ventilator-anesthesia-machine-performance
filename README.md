This project aims to develop a predictive system for assessing the performance and potential failures of ventilators and anesthesia machines using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models. By analyzing historical inspection data, maintenance records, and device performance metrics, the system will predict whether a machine is likely to pass future verifications.
